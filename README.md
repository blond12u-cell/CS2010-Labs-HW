This maze was difficult because the turtle would never check behind themselves and would get stuck in a loop in the big open space, solved by letting the turtle also check behind themselves and moving backwards if they see yellow concrete

Had the added difficulty of going up 2 levels that way it could reach the goal, while also making it accross the large open space. Solved by hugging the wall and adding code to move up if it detected a piece of red concrete below it
